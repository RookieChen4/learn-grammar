# 名词能做什么成分
  1. 主语 The movie looks terrific
  2. 宾语 I admire his mother
  3. 表语 Gump is a man
  4. 同位语 I enjoy the part, the beginning
  #### 同位语：用来解释名词的就是同位语 -- 只要在作文中见到名词都可以在其后面加上同位语用来补充说明
  #### 同位语的成分
    + 名词
    + 代词
    + 非谓语动词
    + 从句
# 什么是名词性从句
  ***名词在句子中充当的成分，从句都能充当就是名词性从句***
  + 主语从句 The movie what I saw looks terrific
  + 宾语从句 I admire what she said
  + 表语从句 Gump is a man who should learn from
  + 同位语从句 I enjoy the part that a  feather is flying in the sky
# 名词性从句的引导词
 + That he has got divorced is my fault
 + Whether he has got divorced is obvious
 + Who he will marry is secret
 ### 名词性从句的引导词是按从句的类型分的类一共3类,并且英语中的从句都一定是陈述句的形式也就是引导词 + 主语 + 谓语的形式 
  1. 当从句是陈述句时，并且that在从句中不充当任何成分
  2. 当从句是一般疑问句时，并且whether也不在从句中充当任何成分，意思翻译成‘是否’
  3. 所有的特殊疑问词，当从句是特殊疑问句时
 #### 练习
  + I am wondering Whether aliens exist (主谓宾)
  + That ladies tend to be right remains common knowledge 
  + My meaning seems that supporting the elderly remains a Chinese conventional vintue(表语从句)
  + Someday,one will perceive that career,kinship and friendship prove more indispensable than romance(that引导的宾语从句)
  + The point seems when wealth will become available for you
# 名词性从句的考点分析
  ## 写作
  1. 主语从句
    ### 主语从句的满分句型(可以写在作文中任何一句话的前面，拉长句子)：
      + 把主语从句放在句末，用it作形式主语，几个满分句型：(It keeps common knowledge that ladies tend to be right)
        + It...that...
        + It is apparent that...
        + It looks beyond dispute that...
        + It has been widely accepted that...
        + It is universally acknowledge that...
        + It keeps my argument that...
      #### 练习
        ***It looks beyond dispute that the issue about diligence has been brought into the limelight***
  2. 同位语从句 即可放在它解释的名字后，也可放在句末
    #### 练习
    The matter that he managed to find a girlfriend makes his superiors rejoiced.
    Nothing can hide the truth that she is getting old.
    The outlook proves wrong that private individuals in HN seem all deceivers
    The evidence that flowers in the greenhouse fail to undergo storms indicates that kids should by no means be spoiled by their senior citizens
  ## 长难句分析
    1. 如何识别主语从句
    2. 如何识别宾语从句 -- 只要实义动词后面有引导词就是宾语从句（除状语从句） 
      **She said (that) she would marry an old man(宾语从句that可以省略)**
      #### 形式宾语 You have all heard it(形式宾语) reapeated that..., that..., and that...
    3. 如何识别表语从句 -- 只要系动词的后面有引导词就是表语从句
    4. 如何识别同位语从句 -- 只要名词的后面有引导词就暂定同位语从句（更可能是定语从句）
